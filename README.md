# BigMart-Sales-Analysis_and-Prediction

# Introduction
This project is an analysis of sales data from a Bigmart store. The purpose of this analysis is to identify key factors that impact sales and to build predictive models that can be used to forecast future sales. In this analysis, we will use Hypothesis Generation to identify potential factors that may impact sales.

# Loading Packages and Data
To begin, we loaded the necessary packages and data. The packages used in this analysis include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data was provided by Bigmart and includes information on sales, product attributes, and store location.

# Data Structure and Content
Next, we explored the structure and content of the data. The data consists of a combination of numerical and categorical variables. There are also missing values in the data, which will need to be addressed.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
To better understand the data, we conducted exploratory data analysis. This involved examining the distribution and correlation of the variables in the data. We also created visualizations to better understand the relationships between the variables.

# Univariate Analysis
In this step, we analyzed each variable in isolation to identify any patterns or trends. This analysis included calculating summary statistics and creating visualizations.

# Bivariate Analysis
Next, we analyzed the relationships between pairs of variables. This analysis included examining correlations and creating scatterplots.

# Missing Value Treatment
After identifying missing values in the data, we implemented strategies to address them. This involved imputing missing values with the mean or median value of the variable, or dropping rows with missing values.

# Feature Engineering
In this step, we created new features from the existing variables. This involved combining variables, creating ratios, and creating dummy variables for categorical variables.

# Encoding Categorical Variables
Next, we encoded the categorical variables in the data. This involved using both Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values that can be used in modeling.

# Preprocessing Data
Before modeling, we preprocessed the data by scaling the numerical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

# Modeling
Finally, we built predictive models using three different techniques: Linear Regression, Regularized Linear Regression, and Random Forest. We also used XGBoost to improve the accuracy of our models.

# Conclusion
Through Hypothesis Generation and the analysis of the Bigmart sales data, we were able to identify key factors that impact sales and build predictive models that can be used to forecast future sales. By implementing the models in practice, Bigmart can optimize their sales and improve their bottom line.
